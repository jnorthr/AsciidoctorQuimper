A thousand photos do not do Crozon justice. I have tried taking
photos from all angles but there's no way to capture the wonder of
this stunning Brittany,France peninsula.


The beautiful seaside resort of Crozon is located in Finistere on an
extensive peninsula, which includes many villages and breath-taking
beaches. The town is located between the Bay of Morgat and the Tip of
Kador, two places to discover through the many walking trails leading
to Camaret Sur Mer. Crozon is an easy drive from our home on brand new
roads.



The peninsula has an abundance of sandy beaches much to the delight of
families and water sports enthusiasts. Crozon has a strong maritime
culture in the heart of this local community; you can even visit boat
cemeteries that are part of the local folklore. (The boat cemetery in
Camaret is well worth a visit.) Hidden away beaches and heather-covered cliffs offer superb panoramas for visitors. 

La Palud, further south, is a famous surf and kite-surf spot. But you can choose the
beaches at Kersiguénou, Postolonnec, Source or Poul. Aber is located
on the estuary. Hiking trails abound, from Cap de la Chèvre to the tip
of Kador or Dinan.


We like to visit in time for sunset and whether it's winter or
summer, the breath-taking scenery never fails to impress. It's a photographer's
dream from the tiny wild flowers growing among sandy grasses on the
cliffs or the huge swaths of heather, that drop away to an often dark and
savage sea below.

Crozon, the town, is not only charming but is home to the famous Morgat
marina. Crozon-Morgat Marina is also known as 'Port de Plaisance Crozon-Morgat' or 'Port of Crozon-Morgat'. The Marina has beautiful surroundings and, thanks to the many facilities that are present within
the area, visitors, those who are in love with exotic destinations,
will be amazed by this mixture of rock and turquoise waters, soft
sands and lush grasses.


Away from the Port, Crozon has many fine old homes and hotels that look
directly onto the vast beaches. These old buildings are often surrounded
with charming gardens, with a dreamy other-worldly elegance. You can visit one of the restaurants, cafés or
creperies for a bite to eat. Crozon is busy in summer with limited
parking. If you are lucky enough to visit, try to take the tourist
boat rides around the peninsula. Also there is a mineral museum that
is well worth a visit too.
